For our group project, we decided to create a game based on the FAMOUS book called "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish" by the well known author, Dr. Seuss.  

In this very diverse world, one should not be judged on by their differences. In our NEVER SEEN BEFORE game, "Flippy Fish", one tries to overcome the hardships of seaweeds and hooks. The changing of the fish, no matter how different the fishies are, deep down, they are the same and should be treated equally.
